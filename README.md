# Simon Game

The Simon Game is a fun and interactive web-based memory game that challenges users to replicate an increasingly complex sequence of lights and sounds. Inspired by the classic electronic game "Simon," this project is an excellent way to learn web development concepts such as event handling, state management, and DOM manipulation.

The game progressively becomes more challenging as the sequence length increases, making it both entertaining and a test of concentration and memory skills.

# Features

- Interactive Gameplay
Players replicate a sequence of colors displayed through visual and auditory feedback.
- Dynamic Difficulty
The sequence length increases with every correct attempt, making the game progressively harder.
- Audio and Visual Feedback
Each button corresponds to a unique color and sound, enhancing the user experience.
- Responsive Design
The game adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

# Technologies Used
- HTML: To structure the game layout.
- CSS: For styling the game elements and creating visual effects.
- JavaScript: For game logic, sequence generation, user interaction, and state management.

# How It Works
- Game Start
The game begins when the player presses a designated key (e.g., Start) or clicks a "Start" button.
- Sequence Generation
A random color is added to the sequence at each level.
- Player Interaction
The player replicates the sequence by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
- Feedback
Correct inputs advance the game to the next level, while incorrect inputs end the game and display a game-over message.
- Game Progression
The game becomes increasingly challenging as the sequence length grows.
